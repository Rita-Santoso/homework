#### 3/19/30, Manager of Shuttle Company
Today, I paid off all my student loans which is practically unheard of nowadays. It's mostly because my side business is going so well. I run a shuttle service company from Canada to the US, but with the recent shift from manual to self driving cars, I've been able to save a lot of money from not employing drivers. In a couple months, I should be able to pay off my mortgage!


#### 3/24/30, Former Taxi Driver
I've been laid off for almost a year now, and I haven't been able to find another job. I've worked as a taxi driver my entire life, and I'm almost 60 now. I don't know any place that would hire me, because every company uses self driving cars now. I understand why; they're statistically safer and cheaper than hiring a driver. The companies that still choose to hire drivers are all going obsolete. I'm losing hope that I'll ever be able to find work again.
