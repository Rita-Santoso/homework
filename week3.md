#### Idea No.19: The Emoticon
What is a 'flame war' and what does it have to do with emoticons?
Flame wars happened in the computer science department online bulletin boards at Carnegie Mellon in the early 1980s, where misunderstandings caused people to be offended by sarcastic posts or jokes. The arguments that followed were called "flame wars", and a particularly intense one happened over a fake mercury spill. To prevent them, Fahlman suggested the character sequence :-) as a joke marker.

What's the difference between an emoticon and an emoji? Support your answer with references beyond the book.
An emoticon contains ASCII characters to create the icon, whereas an emoji is just an image that can be translated across platforms through Unicode.

#### Idea No.24: The JPEG
Boulton explains that a JPEG file has 'lossy' compression. Explain what this means. List and explain a few other kinds of image file compression and the image file types associated with them.
Lossy compression decreases the file size by discarding data. GIFs are an example of lossless compression, meaning no detail is lost in the compression but the file size can't be made as small as a JPEG. PNG files allow for a full range of colors and better compression.

#### Idea No.45: Metadata
List and explain a few examples of metadata beyond the examples given in the book
