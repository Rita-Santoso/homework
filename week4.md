## Homework Week 4
#### 1. Machine Learning
Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention. It infiltrates many different types of enterprise technologies. From customer relationship management software to consumer engagement and network administration, machine learning touches nearly every segment of business.
#### 2. Blockchain
The biggest crypto company, also referred to as a distributed ledger or distributed trust infrastructure, the enterprise use cases for blockchain are perhaps the most innovative of all those on this list. This tech could completely transform supply chain and financial services, among many others. And because this much-hyped technology is still in the early phases of development within enterprises, the next five years will likely bring untold value in ways we haven’t thought of yet.
#### 3. Practical Augmented Reality
Augmented reality is seen most pop-famously in Pokémon Go. Enterprise adoption, while slower than the consumer side, is promising. Company use cases are exciting, despite AR being in the early development and adoption stages. Examples include helping industrial mechanics go hands-free, enabling immersive virtual trainings, improving patient care and delivering innovative retail experiences.
#### 4. Virtual Cloud Network
 NSX brought about the first real networking innovation since the switch: network virtualization. Fast forward nearly five years to the Virtual Cloud Network. A cloud networking fabric with all connected elements run on a common network with the same set of services.
Automation of common networking functions, such as maintenance and patching.
Security that is built in, not bolted on.
#### 5. Google Glass
For better or for worse, Google Glass – the hands-free smartphone-like device –has opened our eyes to a whole new level of existence. Although they’ve halted production of the prototype, Google is committed to continually improving the project.
