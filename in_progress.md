The image is a sketch of the timeline of the piece to plan it beforehand.
I want to make a video or gif that shows a
neuron reassembling into an artificial
neuron. The piece will reflect the
transition of society from a natural state
to heavy reliance on technology and machine learning.
It also shows the complexity of a biological
neuron compared to the simplicity of an
artificial one.
