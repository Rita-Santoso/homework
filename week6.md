## Week 6 Homework
#### 1. Bullet Board Systems

Purple Ocean was a bulletin board system founded in June 1984. The Purple Ocean BBS was best known for its numerous gaming features including numerous different versions and scenarios of Trade Wars 1000, 2000, and 2002. At the high point of its visibility, over 100 different Trade Wars universes were operated simultaneously with thousands of players logging on each day. The Purple Ocean BBS was also the first BBS in Texas to offer 38.4 kbit/s transfer rates for every node. (source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Ocean)
OSUNY (Ohio Scientific Users of New York) was a dial-up bulletin board that was run by two different sysops in the 1980s, "Sysop" while in Scarsdale, New York, and Frank Roberts in White Plains, New York. Named for the Ohio Scientific computer it originally ran on, it attracted a large group of hackers, phone phreaks, engineers, computer programmers, and other technophiles. It remained a haven almost exclusively for the hacker/phreaker community until gaining notoriety through mention in a Newsweek article, Hacking Through NASA: A threat- or only an embarrassment, and mention in the book The Hacker Crackdown as a favored hangout of the notorious hacker group The Legion of Doom, after which it was shuttered, and another board was brought up as a "replacement" known as The Crystal Palace, which was short-lived. OSUNY was restarted soon after, using an Altos 5-15D running MP/M and the continuously evolving Citadel/UX software. Also in the mid-1980s it became the first BBS to be associated with 2600 Magazine. It ran via dial-up until its closing around 1988.(source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSUNY)


#### 2. GeoCities
In response to the closure, rival Web hosting services began to compete for the websites leaving GeoCities. For instance, German Web host Jimdo started the "Lifeboat for GeoCities" service to encourage GeoCities users to put their Web sites on Jimdo. Geocities-closing.com, started by GeoCities competitor uCoz, is a similar project launched to save GeoCities websites. (source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities)
Jason Scott as representative of ArchiveTeam posted on his blog that he was going to save as much of geocities as he can. He enlists the help of his readers, asking for bandwidth and disks. (source: http://ascii.textfiles.com/archives/1956)
Archival efforts to preserve the '90s mainstay have included the Internet Archive's GeoCities Special Collection via the Wayback Machine and separate projects like ReoCities, OoCitie, and GEOCITIES.ws. (source: https://www.engadget.com/2018/10/02/yahoo-japan-geocities-shutting-down/)
