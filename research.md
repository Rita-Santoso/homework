### Research

- Collage of various images representing my research
- 4/3/19

The top half of the collage is a screenshot from an image classification program that I downloaded and ran on Python and is also a picture that I used in my book. I also included the TensorFlow logo because that is something that I researched and I know the program I was experimenting with runs on it. At the bottom left is a picture showing the process of a neural network in image identification. To the right of that is one of the first images I found in my research that shows the similarity in structure between an artificial neuron and a biological neuron.
